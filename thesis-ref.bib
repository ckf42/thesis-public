  abstract      = {In this paper we study a generalized class of Maxwell-Boltzmann equations which in addition to the usual collision term contains a linear deformation term described by a matrix A. This class of equations arises, for instance, from the analysis of homoenergetic solutions for the Boltzmann equation considered by many authors since 1950s. Our main goal is to study a large time asymptotics of solutions under assumption of smallness of the matrix A. The main result of the paper is formulated in Theorem 2.1. Informally stated, this Theorem says that, for sufficiently small norm of A, any non-negative solution with finite second moment tends to a self-similar solution of relatively simple form for large values of time. This is what we call "the self-similar asymptotics". We also prove that the higher order moments of the self-similar profile are finite under further smallness condition on the matrix A.},

These solutions are known as homoenergetic solutions. We prove existence of homoenergetic solutions for a large class of initial data. For different choices for the matrix $A$ and for different homogeneities of the collision kernel, we characterize the long time asymptotics of the velocity distribution for the corresponding homoenergetic solutions. For a large class of choices of $A$ we then prove rigorously the existence of self-similar solutions of the Boltzmann equation. The latter are non Maxwellian distributions and describe far-from-equilibrium flows. For Maxwell molecules we obtain exact formulas for the $H$-function for some of these flows. These formulas show that in some cases, despite being very far from equilibrium, the relationship between density, temperature and entropy is exactly the same as in the equilibrium case. We make conjectures about the asymptotics of homoenergetic solutions that do not have self-similar profiles.},

In the mesoscopic regime, we exploit two interaction scalings that lead, respectively, to either a mean-field type or to a Boltzmann type equation. It turns out that, under the special symmetry of OMD, the mean-field scaling results in vastly simplified dynamics that extinguishes the underlying molecular interaction rule, whereas the Boltzmann scaling yields a meaningful reduced model called the homo-energetic Boltzmann equation. At the macroscopic level, we derive the corresponding Euler and Navier-Stokes systems by conducting a detailed asymptotic analysis. The symmetry again significantly reduces the complexity of the resulting hydrodynamic systems.},

  abstract      = {We will consider a modified Boltzmann equation which contains together with the collision operator an additional drift term that is characterized by a matrix A. Furthermore, we consider a Maxwell gas where the collision kernel has an angular singularity. Such an equation is used in the study of homoenergetic solutions of the Boltzmann equation. Our goal is to prove that under smallness assumptions on the drift term the long-time asymptotics is given by self-similar solutions. We will work in the framework of measure-valued solutions with finite moments of order p > 2 and show existence, uniqueness and stability of these self-similar solutions for sufficiently small A. Furthermore, we will prove that they have finite moments of arbitrary order by decreasing the norm of A, depending on that order. In addition, the singular collision operator allows to prove smoothness of these self-similar solutions. At the end we apply the results to study the asymptotics of homoenergetic solutions in particular cases. This extends previous results from the cutoff case to non cutoff Maxwell gases.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a class of Boltzmann equations on the real line, extensions of the well-known Kac caricature. A distinguishing feature of the corresponding equations is that therein, the collision gain operators are defined by N-linear smoothing transformations. These kind of problems have been studied, from an essentially analytic viewpoint, in a recent paper by Bobylev, Cercignani and Gamba [Comm. Math. Phys. 291 (2009) 599-644]. Instead, the present work rests exclusively on probabilistic methods, based on techniques pertaining to the classical central limit problem and to the so-called fixed-point equations for probability distributions. An advantage of resorting to methods from the probability theory is that the same results - relative to self-similar solutions - as those obtained by Bobylev, Cercignani and Gamba, are here deduced under weaker conditions. In particular, it is shown how convergence to a self-similar solution depends on the belonging of the initial datum to the domain of attraction of a specific stable distribution. Moreover, some results on the speed of convergence are given in terms of Kantorovich-Wasserstein and Zolotarev distances between probability measures.},

These equations describe the change of the velocity distribution in a spatially homogeneous gas due to binary collisions between the particles. We consider a general linear mechanism for the exchange of the particles' momenta, with interaction coefficients that are random matrices with a distribution that is {independent} of the velocities of the colliding particles. Applying a synthesis of probabilistic methods and Fourier analysis, we are able to identify sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stationary state, we characterize this stationary state as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, and we prove equilibration of transient solutions under minimal hypotheses on the initial conditions. In particular, we are able to classify the high-energy tails of the stationary distribution, which might be of Pareto type. We also discuss several examples to which our theory applies, among them models with a non-symmetric stationary state.},

Assuming that the initial measure $\rho_0$ belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law, we describe asymptotic properties of $\rho_t$, as $t\to\infty$. We consider the critical regime when the standard normalization leads to a degenerate limit and find an appropriate scaling ensuring a non-degenerate self-similar limit.

In the course of our work, we significantly weaken the assumptions in the literature that guarantee the existence (and uniqueness) of a solution to the evolution equation $\partial_t \mu_t + \mu_t = Q(\mu_t)$.},

This class of self-similar solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation (BE) for Maxwell molecules was studied by Bobylev and Cercignani in early 2000s. The solutions are positive, but have an infinite second moment (energy). However, the same class of distribution functions with finite energy appears to be closely connected with quite different class of group-invariant solutions of the spatially inhomogeneous BE. This is a motivation for considering the so-called modified spatially homogeneous BE, which contains an extra force term proportional to a matrix $ A $. The modified BE was recently studied under assumption of "sufficient smallness of norm $ \|A\| $" without explicit estimates of the smallness. We fill this gap and prove that all important facts related to self-similar solutions remain valid also for moderate values of $ \|A\| $.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we consider a particular class of solutions to the Boltzmann equation which are referred to as homoenergetic solutions. They describe the dynamics of a dilute gas due to collisions and the action of either a shear, a dilation or a combination of both. We prove that solutions with initially high temperature remain close and converge to a Maxwellian distribution with temperature going to infinity. Furthermore, we give precise asymptotic formulas for the temperature. This local stability result is a consequence of a dominant shear and the homogeneity $ \gamma>0 $ of the collision operator with respect to relative velocities. The proof relies on an ansatz which is motivated by a Hilbert-type expansion. We consider both non-cutoff and cutoff kernels.},

  abstract    = {In the paper we study the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit in a channel domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times (-1,1)$ for the 3D kinetic Couette flow. Our results demonstrate that the first-order approximation of the solutions is governed by the perturbed incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system around the fluid Couette flow. Moverover, in the absence of external forces, the 3D kinetic Couette flow asymptotically converges over time to the 1D steady planar kinetic Couette flow. Our proof relies on (i) the Fourier transform on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to essentially reduce the 3D problem to a one-dimensional one, (ii) anisotropic Chemin-Lerner type function spaces, incorporating the Wiener algebra, to control nonlinear terms and address the singularity associated with a small Knudsen number in the diffusive limit, and (iii) Caflisch's decomposition, combined with the $L^2\cap L^\infty$ interplay technique, to manage the growth of large velocities.},

If the symmetry of the solutions corresponds to shear flows, the existence of stationary solutions can be ruled out because the energy is not conserved. After anisotropic rescaling both equations conserve the energy. We show that the rescaled Boltzmann equation does not admit stationary densities of Maxwellian type (exponentially decaying). For the rescaled Fokker-Planck equation we demonstrate that all solutions converge to a Maxwellian in the long-time limit, however the convergence rate is only algebraic, not exponential.},
