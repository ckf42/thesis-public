\section*{Acknowledgment}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.\ Renjun Duan, for introducing me to the topic of Boltzmann equation and the various research projects, for his emphasis on independent researching propels me forward in my study, and for giving me the great degree of freedom to work on my ideas, far more than a PhD student could ask for.
I am forever grateful for his guidance and teaching, and for providing such nourishing environment for researches.

I would also like to thank Prof.\ Shuaikun Wang for our discussions on the infinite energy solutions, for his critical insights and suggestions have enabled a new perspective on the problem, without which certain parts of this thesis would not be possible.

I am greatly indebted to my long-time colleagues and friends, Zongguang Li, Zhiwen Zhang, Junhao Zhang, Kunlun Qi, and the many people from the Department who have kindly shared with me their intelligence and perspectives.
While we do not necessarily work on the same problem or even be in the same field, I have learned far more from them than I could have expected, and their words have been a constant source of ideas and encouragements.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their constant and unconditional support throughout the years of my studies.
Without them, it would be impossible for me to make any progress, let alone complete this work.
